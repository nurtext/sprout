Hi, I'm a example page for demonstrating additional routes.

To setup a new route (e.g. "my-route.html") just follow these steps:

- Create a config file named "my-route.conf" and put in some values
- Create a new markdown file named "my-route.md" and write your content
- Create a new view file named "my-route.tpl" and copy & paste the code from "index.tpl" into it

Don't forget to store the files into the respective folders and you're ready to go!
