Sprout combines the power of Smarty, Markdown and a flexible routing class to create small websites in no time.

[Link to example route](./example-route.html)   
[Link to route that doesn't exist](./nothing-here.html) (trigger's a 404)

PS: You could also type "index.html" at the end of this url to trigger the default route â€“ which is set to "index.html".
